# GitPulse
a chrome extension to inform users of the activity of repo links before you click them. 


## 🚀 Overview

We’ve all been there: you open a promising new repository to explore, contribute, or file an issue… only to discover it’s a dead project. **GitPulse** saves you time by automatically checking repo activity and adding a visible banner to the top of a GitHub repository’s home page.
